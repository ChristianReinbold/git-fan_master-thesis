\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all I would like to thank apl.~Professor Anne Frühbis\=/Krüger for establishing contact to Kaiserslautern and dealing with all the organisational issues emerging from writing a master's thesis in cooperation with remote institutes. Further, I also thank Doctor Janko Böhm for entrusting me with his research topic and giving a thorough introduction of the problem.

At the \acl{Fraunhofer ITWM}, Doctor Mirko Rahn guided my efforts and has been available for any kind of technical questions. I thank him not only for this, but also for him and Bernd Lörwald reviewing probably every single line of code with meticulous precision, sharing their years of experience with me whenever I produced code making each reasonable software engineer cringe. I am especially grateful for Sonja Menßen who told me about her working on a thesis in cooperation with Fraunhofer. Without her, I never would have seized the opportunity of escaping Hannover and advancing my studies at the exciting Fraunhofer Society. I also thank her, Maya Thürnau and Antonio Pandza for proofreading the upcoming pages and suffering from all my errors. As always, the own flaws are the hardest to detect.

Finally, I want to say thank you to Lukas Ristau who invited me to the \emph{Pfalztheater} and thus made my stay at Kaiserslautern worthwile not only in working but also in cultural aspects.
