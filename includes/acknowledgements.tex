\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all I would like to thank apl. Professor Anne Frühbis\=/Krüger for establishing contact to Kaiserslautern and dealing with all the organisational issues emerging from writing a master's thesis in cooperation with remote institutes. Further I would like to thank Doctor Mirko Rahn and Bernd Lörwald for reviewing probably every single line of code with meticulous precision, and for sharing their years of experience with me whenever I produced code making each reasonable software engineer cringe. I am especially grateful for Sonja Menßen who told me about her working on a thesis in cooperation with the \acl{Fraunhofer ITWM}. Without her, I never would have seized the opportunity of escaping Hannover and advancing my studies at the exciting Fraunhofer Society. I also thank her and \todo{all the other proofreaders - Sonja ggf. rausnehmen} for proofreading the upcoming pages and suffering from all my errors. As always, the own flaws are the hardest to detect.
